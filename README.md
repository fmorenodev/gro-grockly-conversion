# gro-grockly-conversion

The purpose of this project is to be able to convert .gro code to grockly blocks ready to be read, simulated or edited easily.
This is part of Fernando Moreno's computer science end-of-degree work. Grockly was developed by Aitor Moya.

TO-DO LIST:

  * ~~open github repository~~  
  * ~~incorporate grockly and figure how to translate a line of code into a block~~ 
  * ~~learn how to generate a block in screen~~
  * parse each type of valid expression in grockly (a valid expression is one that can be converted into a block)
  * generate each type of block
    * ~~Experiment~~ 
    * ~~Ecoli~~
    * ~~Plasmid~~
    * ~~Operon~~
    * ~~Promoter~~
    * ~~Protein~~
    * ~~ProteinL (for promoter)~~
    * Actions
    * ~~Nutrients~~
    * Signals
  * Connect blocks 
    * ~~Experiment~~
